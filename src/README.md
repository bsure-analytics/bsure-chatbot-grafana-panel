- UI-based setup â€“ no manual config required

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Set Your Groq API Key

To use this plugin, you must provide your **Groq API Key**. This is used to authenticate your chatbot with Groq's language models.

1. Get your API key from [Groq.com](https://groq.com/)
2. Paste it into the plugin settings

### 2. Define the Bot's Role

In the plugin settings, you can provide an **initial message**, also called the **system prompt**. This message sets the role of the bot and determines how it should respond.

> ðŸ’¡ _Example:_  
> `"You are an analytical assistant for a Grafana dashboard. Summarize trends, detect anomalies, and answer questions based on incoming JSON data."`

Consider refining this prompt to get better and more focused answers.

### 3. Link Data Sources

To provide data to the AI:

- Select the **Dashboard** as the data source via the UI
- The plugin will automatically gather the linked data and convert it into JSON format
- This data will be sent alongside user questions to provide context

> ðŸ“Œ _Only panels with Dashboard as their data source will supply data to the bot._

---

## ðŸ’¬ Asking Questions

Once configured, simply ask your chatbot questions about the linked dashboard data â€” such as:

- "What trends do you see?"
- "Are there any unusual spikes?"
- "Can you summarize this week's performance?"

The bot will use the current JSON dataset and system prompt to generate responses.
