# ðŸ§  b.sure Chatbot Grafana Panel

A Grafana panel plugin that provides an AI-powered chat interface for analyzing dashboard data.
This plugin enriches user questions with dashboard context and sends them to Groq's LLM API for intelligent responses.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface within Grafana dashboards
- Automatic extraction and enrichment of dashboard data
- Integration with Groq API for AI-powered responses
- Configurable system prompts and LLM models
- Real-time analysis of panel data across your dashboard

## Requirements

- Grafana >= 10.4.0
- Node.js >= 22
- Groq API key

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The plugin requires the following environment variable to be set on the Grafana server:

- **GROQ_API_KEY**: Your Groq API key for LLM access

### Panel Configuration

The plugin provides the following configuration options in the panel editor:

- **Initial Chat Message**: System prompt to guide the AI's behavior
- **LLM Model**: Select the Groq model to use (default: llama-3.3-70b-versatile)

### Security Architecture

âœ… **Secure Backend Implementation**: This plugin includes a Go backend component that securely handles the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable.
The frontend never accesses API keys directly, ensuring enterprise-grade security.

## Usage

1. Set the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable on your Grafana server
2. Add the Chatbot Panel to your dashboard
3. Configure the panel settings (initial message, LLM model)
4. Type questions about your dashboard data in the chat interface
5. The plugin will automatically enrich your question with data from all panels in the dashboard
6. Receive AI-powered insights based on your data

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 22 or higher
- **Go**: Version 1.21 or higher (for backend component)
- **npm**: Version 10.9 or higher
- **Docker**: Required for running the development server
- **Groq API Key**: Required for LLM functionality

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bsure-chatbot-grafana-panel
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Build the plugin (frontend + backend)**

   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   Grafana will be available at http://localhost:3000

### Development Workflow

**Frontend Development:**

- `npm run dev` - Build frontend in watch mode (auto-rebuilds on changes)
- Edit files in `src/` directory
- Changes are automatically picked up by webpack

**Backend Development:**

- `npm run dev:backend` - Build backend for current platform
- Edit files in `pkg/` directory
- Restart Docker container after backend changes: `docker compose restart`

**Full Development Cycle:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Build backend and start frontend watch
npm run dev:all

# Terminal 2: Start Grafana server
npm run server

# When making backend changes:
npm run dev:backend && docker compose restart
```

### Build Commands

- `npm run build` - Build frontend in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Build frontend in development mode with watch
- `npm run dev:backend` - Build backend for current platform
- `npm run build:backend` - Build backend for production
- `npm run build:all` - Build both frontend and backend for production
- `npm run dev:all` - Build backend and start frontend in watch mode
- `npm run clean` - Clean build artifacts

### Testing

- `npm run test` - Run tests in watch mode (requires `git init` first)
- `npm run test:ci` - Run tests once (CI mode)
- `npm run e2e` - Run E2E tests (requires server running)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run linter and apply fixes
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Environment Variables

The plugin requires the following environment variable:

- **GROQ_API_KEY**: Your Groq API key for LLM access

```bash
# Set environment variable (Linux/macOS)
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Windows PowerShell
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Troubleshooting

**Plugin not loading:**

- Ensure backend is built: `npm run dev:backend`
- Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs`
- Verify API key is set: `echo $GROQ_API_KEY`

**Backend changes not reflecting:**

- Rebuild backend: `npm run dev:backend`
- Restart container: `docker compose restart`

**API errors:**

- Verify GROQ_API_KEY is correctly set and valid
- Check Grafana logs for backend errors

### Testing Different Grafana Versions

```bash
# Use specific Grafana version
GRAFANA_VERSION=11.3.0 npm run server

# Use Grafana Enterprise
GRAFANA_IMAGE=grafana-enterprise npm run server
```

## Distributing your plugin

When distributing a Grafana plugin either within the community or privately the plugin must be signed so the Grafana application can verify its authenticity. This can be done with the `@grafana/sign-plugin` package.

_Note: It's not necessary to sign a plugin during development. The docker development environment that is scaffolded with `@grafana/create-plugin` caters for running the plugin without a signature._

### Initial steps

Before signing a plugin please read the Grafana [plugin publishing and signing criteria](https://grafana.com/legal/plugins/#plugin-publishing-and-signing-criteria) documentation carefully.

`@grafana/create-plugin` has added the necessary commands and workflows to make signing and distributing a plugin via the grafana plugins catalog as straightforward as possible.

Before signing a plugin for the first time please consult the Grafana [plugin signature levels](https://grafana.com/legal/plugins/#what-are-the-different-classifications-of-plugins) documentation to understand the differences between the types of signature level.

1. Create a [Grafana Cloud account](https://grafana.com/signup).
2. Make sure that the first part of the plugin ID matches the slug of your Grafana Cloud account.
   - _You can find the plugin ID in the `plugin.json` file inside your plugin directory. For example, if your account slug is `acmecorp`, you need to prefix the plugin ID with `acmecorp-`._
3. Create a Grafana Cloud API key with the `PluginPublisher` role.
4. Keep a record of this API key as it will be required for signing a plugin

### Signing a plugin

#### Using Github actions release workflow

If the plugin is using the github actions supplied with `@grafana/create-plugin` signing a plugin is included out of the box. The [release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) can prepare everything to make submitting your plugin to Grafana as easy as possible. Before being able to sign the plugin however a secret needs adding to the Github repository.

1. Please navigate to "settings > secrets > actions" within your repo to create secrets.
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name the secret "GRAFANA_API_KEY"
4. Paste your Grafana Cloud API key in the Secret field
5. Click "Add secret"

##### Push a version tag

To trigger the workflow we need to push a version tag to github. This can be achieved with the following steps:

1. Run `npm version <major|minor|patch>`
2. Run `git push origin main --follow-tags`
